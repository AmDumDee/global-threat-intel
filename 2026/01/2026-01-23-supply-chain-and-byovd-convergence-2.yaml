  executive_decisions:
    - priority: "Critical"
      decision: "Mandatory Migration to Phishing-Resistant MFA (FIDO2/WebAuthn)"
      business_justification: "Traditional MFA (SMS/Push) is now a liability. Phishing-resistant methods prevent 99% of bulk credential theft and vishing-based bypasses."
      cost_estimate: "$50k - $250k (hardware keys) or platform-native passkey enrollment."
    
    - priority: "Critical"
      decision: "Establish a 'Build-Stage' Security Firewall"
      business_justification: "CISA's inclusion of Vite and Prettier in the KEV catalog means unvetted developer tools are now a primary entry point. We must control what enters our codebases."
      cost_estimate: "Engineering time for pnpm migration and software bill of materials (SBOM) automation."

    - priority: "High"
      decision: "Implement Session Lifecycle Management"
      business_justification: "To combat the 'Bearer Link' model in SMS and AiTM session theft. Links must expire in <15 mins and session tokens must be bound to specific devices/IPs."
      cost_estimate: "Moderate (Infrastructure update/SaaS configuration change)."

  governance_implications:
    board_reporting: |
      - Mean Time to Patch (MTTP) for CISA KEV vulnerabilities (Target: <15 days per BOD 22-01).
      - Percentage of privileged accounts transitioned to FIDO2 security keys.
      - Number of unexpired legacy SMS magic links successfully revoked.
      - Vendor Security Rating (specifically focusing on suppliers' CI/CD security posture).
    
    disclosure_requirements: |
      - SEC/Global mandates: Supply chain compromises (Vite/Prettier) may require material impact disclosure if they result in PII exfiltration (Under Armour scenario).
      - Immediate notification of affected users if active SMS magic links are found to be leaked.

analysis_and_insights:
  uncomfortable_truths: |
    Convenience has become the enemy of security. We have built an entire customer and developer experience 
    on 'magic links' and 'npm install'—methods that assume a trust level that no longer exists in 2026. 
    The 'Human Firewall' is a myth; if an employee is guided through a malicious passkey setup by a 
    convincing AI-assisted voice, they will fail 10 out of 10 times.

    Furthermore, our EDR/AV solutions are 'permission-based.' If an attacker can load a malicious 
    driver (BYOVD), they essentially 'revoke' your security software's permission to see the attack. 
    A security tool that can be turned off by the system it is supposed to protect is not a guarantee, 
    but a suggestion.

  strategic_lessons:
    - "If you don't own the build tool (Vite/Prettier), you don't own the software."
    - "A URL is a password that doesn't look like one. Treat 'Magic Links' with the same rigor as root credentials."
    - "Detection-only strategies fail against kernel-level (BYOVD) ransomware like Osiris."

forward_outlook:
  predictions: |
    In the next 6-12 months, we expect 'VaaS' (Vishing-as-a-Service) to integrate real-time deepfake 
    audio of company executives to authorize large-scale supply chain changes. 
    The battle will move from the 'network edge' to the 'kernel' and the 'developer's laptop.' 
    Companies that successfully implement 'Zero Trust for Tools'—treating every package and 
    every link as hostile until cryptographically verified—will be the only ones to maintain 
    operational resilience.

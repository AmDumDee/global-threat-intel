  severity_business: "Critical"
  severity_technical: "Critical"
  
  executive_summary: |
    The final week of January 2026 marks a pivotal shift in adversary tactics. Attackers have successfully 
    moved 'upstream' into the software supply chain (Vite/Prettier) and 'downstream' into the OS kernel 
    via BYOVD attacks (Osiris). These developments mean that traditional detection tools (EDR/AV) and 
    perimeter defenses are being bypassed by design rather than through exploit. Organizations are 
    currently facing a 'Governance Gap' where digital convenience (SMS links) and developer efficiency 
    (unvetted AI/npm tools) are creating multi-year liabilities.

threat_intelligence:
  what_happened:
    incident_overview: |
      Five distinct but related threats emerged this week. First, the Osiris ransomware targeted a major 
      food service franchisee, using the POORTRY driver to disable security software—a 'Bring Your Own 
      Vulnerable Driver' (BYOVD) attack that renders EDR blind. Simultaneously, CISA flagged that 
      standard developer tools (Vite, Prettier) are being used as delivery vehicles for malware. 
      Furthermore, Under Armour is investigating a 72-million record breach, while new research 
      reveals that SMS-based 'magic links' used for customer convenience remain active and exploitable 
      for over two years, acting as long-term backdoors into PII.
    
    affected_organizations:
      - name: "Under Armour"
        impact: "Alleged 72M records exposed; significant brand trust and regulatory scrutiny."
      - name: "Southeast Asian Food Franchisee"
        impact: "Total operational stoppage via Osiris ransomware; data exfiltration to Wasabi cloud."
      - name: "Global Developer Ecosystem"
        impact: "Active exploitation of Vite and Prettier packages affecting CI/CD pipelines."
    
    attack_methodology: |
      1. Entry: Supply chain compromise via malicious npm/JavaScript packages (Vite/Prettier) 
         leveraged by developers.
      2. Disablement: Deployment of POORTRY/BYOVD drivers to terminate security processes (KillAV).
      3. Persistence/Exfiltration: Use of 'Residential Proxies' and 'Kimwolf' botnets (2M+ devices) 
         to mask data movement.
      4. Long-tail Access: Exploitation of unexpired SMS URLs to harvest PII over months or years.
  
  why_it_matters:
    business_risks:
      financial_exposure: |
        Direct ransomware costs average $1.5M+, but supply chain remediation for a single 
        poisoned library can cost mid-sized firms upwards of $500k in engineering hours alone.
      
      regulatory_compliance: |
        CISA BOD 22-01 mandates federal fixes by Feb 12, 2026. Private firms failing to address 
        these KEV catalog items face extreme liability under 'Reasonable Security' standards.
      
      competitive_impact: |
        The TikTok USDS Joint Venture sets a new bar for 'Algorithm Security' and third-party 
        auditing. Companies unable to prove similar data sovereignty will lose government contracts.
      
      operational_disruption: |
        Osiris demonstrates the ability to kill Veeam and volume shadow copies, extending 
        recovery timelines from days to weeks.
    
    industry_patterns:
      affected_sectors:
        - "Retail & E-commerce (PII Theft)"
        - "Software Development (Supply Chain)"
        - "Critical Infrastructure (OT/IoT Botnets)"
      
      trend_analysis: |
        We are moving from 'Exploit-based' attacks to 'Identity and Workflow-based' attacks. 
        Adversaries are now 'living off the build' rather than 'living off the land.'

**Activists hijacked Iran's state TV satellite for 10 minutes. Your broadcast infrastructure has the same vulnerability.**

Not hackers. Activists.

Reza Pahlavi's team broadcast anti-regime protests across Iran's state television by compromising the Badr satellite. Ten minutes of unrestricted airtime. 70+ million viewers. Zero warning.

Meanwhile, Fortinet shipped CVE-2025-64155 with public exploit code—unauthenticated remote code execution on FortiSIEM. And 679,910 IPs are brute-forcing SSH credentials while you read this.

Here's what your board isn't hearing:

→ Satellite uplinks aren't secured—they're legacy infrastructure nobody audits
→ FortiSIEM protects your security operations; when it's compromised, attackers see everything you see
→ SSH brute-force is now 680K IPs strong—your "secure" remote access is under siege
→ One compromised credential = full network access (ask Cisco about CVE-2025-20393 zero-day)

I've watched two media companies this month discover their satellite uplinks had default credentials. Not for months. For years.

The uncomfortable truth?

Iran's state TV got hijacked because broadcast infrastructure lives in a security blind spot. Your organization has the same blind spots: legacy systems nobody owns, credentials nobody rotates, infrastructure "too critical to patch."

Activists broadcast to 70M people with one satellite compromise.

Question for CISOs:

When was the last time you audited credentials on your broadcast systems, building management, HVAC controllers, or any other "operational tech" that seemed too boring to hack?

Or are we still pretending attackers only target what's in your asset inventory?

Drop your take below. 👇

P.S. If Iranian state TV—with nation-state defensive capabilities—can get owned by activists for 10 minutes of live broadcast, how long would it take someone to compromise your investor relations webcast?

  title: "When Activists Hijack State TV: The Legacy Infrastructure Nobody Audits"
  report_date: "2026-01-18"
  threat_id: "TI-20260118-001"
  severity_business: "High"
  severity_technical: "High"
  
  executive_summary: |
    Anti-regime activists hijacked Iran's Badr satellite on January 18, 2026, broadcasting Reza Pahlavi's protest calls across state television channels for approximately 10 minutes starting 9:30pm local time. The broadcast reached 70+ million potential viewers, displayed protest footage, international solidarity messages, and appeals to military forces to support demonstrators. NetBlocks confirmed internet traffic in Iran dropped following the incident after brief restoration of Google and messaging services. The satellite compromise demonstrates that broadcast infrastructure—traditionally considered operational technology outside cybersecurity scope—represents critical attack surface for adversaries seeking mass communication disruption or manipulation.
    
    Simultaneously, Fortinet disclosed CVE-2025-64155, a critical FortiSIEM vulnerability allowing unauthenticated remote code execution, now accompanied by public proof-of-concept exploit code. FortiSIEM is security information and event management platform organizations use to monitor security operations; its compromise provides attackers visibility into detection capabilities, incident response procedures, and security blind spots. Cisco patched CVE-2025-20393, AsyncOS vulnerability exploited as zero-day by suspected Chinese attackers since November 2025 targeting Email Security Gateway devices. SSH honeypot monitoring reveals 679,910 unique malicious IPs conducting automated brute-force attacks globally. OpenAI testing new "Sonata" feature with dedicated API subdomain, raising questions about AI service expansion and security implications.
    
    Board-level urgency stems from converging realities: (1) Legacy infrastructure including satellites, broadcast systems, building controls, and OT devices exist outside traditional cybersecurity programs despite representing high-impact attack vectors. (2) Security operations tools like FortiSIEM becoming primary targets because their compromise blinds defenders while providing attackers roadmap of security controls. (3) 680K IPs conducting persistent SSH brute-force demonstrates credential-based attacks remain dominant vector despite decades of security awareness. Organizations must audit all legacy infrastructure with communication or control capabilities within 60 days, implement monitoring for security tool compromise, and eliminate credential-based authentication for critical systems or accept that blind spots will be exploited for maximum-impact attacks like Iran satellite hijack.

  what_happened:
    incident_overview: |
      Anti-regime activists executed sophisticated attack on Iran's Badr satellite infrastructure, achieving approximately 10 minutes of unauthorized broadcast time across state television channels on January 18, 2026. Attack commenced around 9:30pm local time according to Israeli broadcaster KAN News. Hijacked broadcast displayed footage of anti-government protests, international solidarity demonstrations, messages from global leaders supporting Iranian protesters, and video of exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi calling for continued demonstrations and urging military/security forces to support protesters rather than regime.
      
      Reza Pahlavi's media team confirmed and shared footage of broadcast hijack on social media platform X. Iran International English reported multiple state TV channels carried on Badr satellite were compromised simultaneously, suggesting attackers gained control of satellite uplink infrastructure rather than individual broadcast facilities. Messages appeared in Farsi encouraging protesters to continue activities while showcasing worldwide support. Following broadcast, NetBlocks documented significant drop in internet traffic across Iran after brief period where Google services and messaging platforms were partially restored, indicating government response to limit information dissemination about protest activities and satellite compromise.
      
      Fortinet disclosed CVE-2025-64155, critical vulnerability in FortiSIEM security platform now accompanied by publicly released proof-of-concept exploit code. Vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute unauthorized code or commands on vulnerable FortiSIEM deployments via specially crafted TCP requests. FortiSIEM serves as centralized security operations platform organizations use to aggregate logs, detect threats, and coordinate incident response. Compromise provides attackers complete visibility into security monitoring capabilities, detection rules, incident response playbooks, and security team activities—effectively blinding defenders while providing roadmap of defenses to evade.
      
      Cisco shipped security updates fixing CVE-2025-20393, AsyncOS vulnerability in Email Security Gateway and Secure Email and Web Manager devices exploited as zero-day by suspected Chinese attackers since at least November 2025. Zero-day exploitation lasted minimum two months before vendor acknowledgment and patch availability, indicating sophisticated threat actors maintain access to vulnerability discovery and exploitation capabilities outpacing defensive patching cycles. SSH honeypot monitoring reveals 679,910 unique malicious IP addresses conducting automated brute-force attacks targeting SSH infrastructure globally, with concentrations in Romania, Netherlands, China, United States, and Canada.

    attack_methodology: |
      Iran satellite hijack demonstrates sophisticated understanding of broadcast infrastructure vulnerabilities. Attackers targeted Badr satellite uplink systems rather than individual broadcast facilities, enabling simultaneous compromise of multiple state TV channels. Satellite uplinks typically use legacy authentication mechanisms, default credentials, or weak access controls because they were deployed before modern cybersecurity practices and are rarely audited or updated. Physical security around ground stations may exist, but network security, credential management, and access logging are often minimal or non-existent.
      
      Once attackers gained access to satellite uplink infrastructure—likely through compromised credentials, vulnerable management interfaces, or insider assistance—they could inject arbitrary content into broadcast stream. Ten-minute duration suggests either: (1) attackers maintained persistent access and chose limited broadcast window for maximum impact with minimal detection risk, or (2) defenders detected compromise and regained control after 10 minutes. Broadcasting during prime evening hours (9:30pm) maximized viewer count and media attention. Content selection—protest footage, international solidarity, Pahlavi's appeals—was carefully curated for psychological impact on Iranian public and international audience.
      
      FortiSIEM compromise via CVE-2025-64155 follows pattern where security tools become high-value targets. Attackers send specially crafted TCP requests to unauthenticated interfaces, achieving remote code execution on FortiSIEM platform. Once compromised, attackers gain access to: all security logs aggregated from enterprise environment, detection rules revealing what security team monitors, incident response playbooks showing defensive procedures, security team communications and investigations, and ability to modify logs hiding their activities across enterprise. This "blinding the defender" strategy is more valuable than compromising individual systems because it provides persistent visibility into security operations while hiding attacker presence.
      
      Cisco AsyncOS zero-day exploitation demonstrates advanced persistent threat methodology where sophisticated actors discover vulnerabilities, develop exploits, and maintain access for months before detection. November 2025 through January 2026 represents minimum two-month exploitation window; actual compromise may have begun earlier. Chinese attribution suggests state-sponsored espionage objectives targeting email communications for intelligence gathering. Zero-day exploitation enables attackers to bypass security controls because no patches exist and detection signatures don't recognize novel exploitation techniques. SSH brute-force campaigns use automated tools testing credentials across 680K+ distributed attack infrastructure, eventually succeeding against systems with weak passwords, default credentials, or inadequate lockout policies.
  
  why_it_matters:
    business_risks:
      financial_exposure: |
        Broadcast infrastructure compromise creates direct financial impact through brand damage, regulatory penalties, and operational disruption. Iran state TV hijack damaged government credibility domestically and internationally—analogous corporate scenario where attackers broadcast unauthorized content through investor relations, customer communications, or corporate media channels would create immediate stock price impact, customer trust erosion, and regulatory scrutiny. Conservative estimate: unauthorized 10-minute broadcast on corporate channels could trigger $10-50M market cap loss through investor panic plus $5-20M emergency response and remediation costs.
        
        FortiSIEM compromise creates cascading financial exposure exceeding direct breach costs. When security operations platform is compromised, all security investments become ineffective—EDR, SIEM, firewall logs, and incident response capabilities are visible to attackers who can evade detection indefinitely. Typical enterprise security stack costs $5-20M annually; FortiSIEM compromise renders this investment useless while attackers maintain persistent access. Breach costs multiply when attackers have months or years of undetected access enabled by security tool compromise: intellectual property theft, customer data exfiltration, and regulatory violations accumulate while defenders remain blind. Total cost: $50-200M for breaches enabled by compromised security operations platforms.
        
        Zero-day exploitation creates liability exposure organizations cannot prevent through normal patching. Cisco AsyncOS attacks ran November 2025 through January 2026 before patches existed. Organizations suffering breaches during this window cannot be faulted for failing to patch—no patch existed. However, cyber insurance increasingly includes "vulnerability management" clauses that may deny coverage if vendors later reveal vulnerabilities existed before exploitation. Legal ambiguity about liability when zero-days are later disclosed creates uninsurable risk.
      
      regulatory_compliance: |
        Broadcast infrastructure compromise in regulated industries triggers FCC oversight for broadcasters, SEC disclosure requirements for public companies using hijacked channels for investor communications, and potential national security investigations if critical infrastructure messaging is manipulated. Iran satellite hijack demonstrated foreign actors or activists can manipulate mass communication channels—applicable to emergency alert systems, public safety communications, and critical infrastructure coordination platforms in Western countries.
        
        FortiSIEM compromise creates SOC 2, ISO 27001, and compliance framework failures. Security certifications require demonstrable logging, monitoring, and incident detection capabilities. When SIEM platform is compromised, audit trail integrity is destroyed and certifications become invalid. Customers may invoke right-to-audit clauses, suspend contracts pending security validation, or demand re-certification at supplier expense. Regulatory examinations in financial services, healthcare, and critical infrastructure sectors explicitly verify security monitoring capabilities; compromised SIEM creates automatic audit finding requiring disclosure and remediation plans.
        
        CISA adding vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-64155 to Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog creates mandatory remediation timelines for federal agencies and establishes private sector expectations. SEC cyber disclosure rules require material incident reporting within 4 business days; FortiSIEM compromise affecting security operations likely meets materiality threshold given impact on security posture and potential for undetected breaches during compromise period.
      
      competitive_impact: |
        Organizations suffering broadcast infrastructure hijacks face permanent brand damage and customer trust erosion. Iran state TV's credibility was destroyed in 10 minutes—corporate equivalent where attackers broadcast fake product recalls, false financial results, or damaging statements through investor relations channels would create irreversible market position damage. Competitors weaponize incidents in sales processes: "Unlike [compromised competitor], our broadcast systems are secured and audited."
        
        FortiSIEM users face competitive disadvantage if compromise becomes public. Enterprise buyers demand security operations visibility and incident response capabilities as contract requirements. Organizations unable to guarantee SIEM integrity lose competitive positioning against vendors demonstrating secured monitoring infrastructure. Security tool vendors suffering platform compromises face existential competitive threats—SolarWinds lost 40% market value following 2020 compromise; Fortinet could face similar customer exodus if CVE-2025-64155 exploitation becomes widespread.
        
        Zero-day exploitation creates asymmetric competitive impact. Organizations suffering breaches via Cisco AsyncOS zero-day during November 2025-January 2026 window face customer losses and reputation damage while competitors using different email security platforms remain unaffected. Market consolidates around vendors with better security track records, creating permanent share shifts.
      
      operational_disruption: |
        Satellite hijack required immediate operational response including satellite control recovery, broadcast verification, content review, and forensic investigation. Organizations experiencing similar broadcast infrastructure compromise face 2-4 week disruption while confirming content integrity, rebuilding trust, and implementing enhanced controls. For media companies, broadcasters, or organizations relying on satellite communications, this represents complete operational cessation during recovery period.
        
        FortiSIEM compromise forces complete security operations rebuild. Organizations cannot trust any logs, detections, or incident investigations conducted while SIEM was compromised. Forensic teams must assume all security data is tainted and rebuild security monitoring from scratch using parallel systems. This process consumes 3-6 months requiring: new SIEM platform deployment, log source re-integration, detection rule migration, historical log analysis determining what attackers saw/modified, and security team retraining. During rebuild, organization operates with degraded security visibility creating window of vulnerability.
        
        Zero-day exploitation remediation extends beyond patching. Cisco AsyncOS attacks running November 2025-January 2026 mean organizations must conduct forensic investigation of all email traffic during two-month window to determine what data was accessed, what communications were monitored, and whether attackers modified email content. Email forensics across two months for enterprise organization costs $500K-2M and takes 2-4 months, diverting IT resources from business priorities.

      trend_analysis: |
        Legacy infrastructure attacks are increasing as adversaries recognize these systems exist outside modern security programs. Iran satellite hijack, like previous attacks on building management systems, HVAC controllers, and industrial control systems, exploits organizational blind spot where operational technology isn't inventoried, monitored, or secured. These systems often run with default credentials, lack logging, and have no patch management because "they're not part of IT infrastructure." Trend accelerating: expect more attacks targeting broadcast systems, emergency alert infrastructure, traffic control, and public address systems as activists and adversaries discover political or psychological impact exceeds technical difficulty.
        
        Security operations tools becoming primary targets represents strategic evolution. Attackers understand compromising FortiSIEM, Splunk, or other SIEM platforms provides persistent visibility into defenses while blinding security teams. CVE-2025-64155 with public PoC will drive targeted exploitation against FortiSIEM installations globally. Security vendors must treat their platforms as critical infrastructure requiring security investment exceeding typical enterprise software because compromise affects all customers simultaneously. Expect increased targeting of EDR platforms, SOAR tools, and security orchestration systems throughout 2026.
        
        Zero-day exploitation is accelerating with state-sponsored actors maintaining significant capability advantages. Cisco AsyncOS attacks demonstrate two-month minimum exploitation window before vendor awareness—actual compromise may have begun earlier. Advanced persistent threats possess vulnerability research capabilities producing steady stream of zero-days while defensive patching operates on months-long cycles. This asymmetry is permanent: attackers will always have zero-days, defenders will always be patching historical vulnerabilities. Organizations must architect for "assume breach" and zero-trust models rather than perimeter defense.

Include broadcast systems, satellite uplinks, building controls, HVAC, fire suppression, emergency alerts, public address, and any OT devices outside traditional IT inventory. Require credential rotation and network segmentation for all identified systems."
      business_justification: "Iran satellite hijack demonstrates legacy infrastructure represents high-impact attack vector outside security program visibility. Organizations discover they have broadcast capabilities, satellite uplinks, or communication systems with default credentials only after compromise. Audit cost ($200-500K) identifies blind spots before adversaries exploit them. Iran's 10-minute hijack damaged regime credibility permanently; analogous corporate incident could cost $50-100M in brand damage and emergency response."
      cost_estimate: "$200K-500K comprehensive legacy infrastructure audit; $500K-2M remediation and segmentation"
    
    - priority: "Critical"
      decision: "Implement security operations platform integrity monitoring with out-of-band verification. Deploy independent monitoring specifically watching FortiSIEM, Splunk, or other SIEM platforms for unauthorized access, configuration changes, or data manipulation. Establish integrity baselines and alert on deviations."
      business_justification: "CVE-2025-64155 demonstrates security tools are high-value targets because their compromise blinds defenders. Organizations cannot rely on SIEM to detect its own compromise—requires independent monitoring. Out-of-band SIEM monitoring ($300-800K) provides early warning when security operations platform is targeted. Without it, attackers gain months of undetected access as seen in Cisco AsyncOS zero-day exploitation November 2025-January 2026."
      cost_estimate: "$300K-800K independent security operations platform monitoring and integrity verification system"
    
    - priority: "Critical"
      decision: "Eliminate password-based SSH authentication across all critical systems within 90 days. Mandate certificate-based or hardware token authentication for SSH access. Implement session recording and behavior analytics for all administrative access."
      business_justification: "679,910 IPs conducting SSH brute-force demonstrates credential-based attacks remain dominant despite decades of security awareness. Password authentication is fundamentally vulnerable to brute-force regardless of complexity requirements. Certificate/hardware token migration ($500K-2M) eliminates entire attack class. SSH compromise provides administrative access to servers, network devices, and OT systems—single compromised SSH credential can enable enterprise-wide lateral movement."

      decision: "Establish zero-day response playbook assuming security tools themselves may be compromised. Define procedures for detecting breaches when SIEM is untrusted, incident response when EDR is compromised, and forensics when logging infrastructure is tainted. Conduct annual tabletop exercise simulating security tool compromise."
      business_justification: "Cisco AsyncOS zero-day ran two months before patches. FortiSIEM CVE with public PoC will be exploited before organizations patch. Traditional incident response assumes security tools are trustworthy—invalid assumption when tools are primary targets. Zero-day playbook ($100-300K development) enables response when normal security infrastructure is compromised. Tabletop exercises validate procedures before real incidents when improvisation fails under pressure."

      decision: "Require vendor security attestations for all AI services including OpenAI integrations. As new features like 'Sonata' launch, mandate security review before production deployment. Establish AI service change management requiring impact assessment for new capabilities, API endpoints, or data handling changes."
      business_justification: "OpenAI's Sonata feature testing indicates continuous service evolution. Organizations integrated with AI APIs must evaluate security implications of new capabilities before they're enabled by default. AI service changes can introduce data exposure risks, new attack surfaces, or compliance violations. Change management framework ($50-150K) prevents uncontrolled AI capability expansion creating security gaps. Recent SesameOp backdoor using OpenAI API for C2 demonstrates AI services can be weaponized."
      cost_estimate: "$50K-150K AI service change management framework and vendor attestation process"

  governance_implications:
    board_reporting: |
      Board-level legacy infrastructure metrics required quarterly: (1) Inventory completion percentage for all operational technology and communication systems outside traditional IT purview, target 100% by Q3 2026. (2) Percentage of identified legacy systems with default credentials, weak authentication, or no network segmentation. (3) Security operations platform integrity verification results including monitoring coverage and alert response times. (4) SSH infrastructure secured with certificate/hardware authentication vs. password-based, target 100% migration by Q4 2026. (5) Zero-day incident response playbook validation results from tabletop exercises.
      
      Material incidents involving broadcast infrastructure hijack, security operations platform compromise, or zero-day exploitation enabling multi-month access must be escalated to board within 24 hours. Iran satellite hijack demonstrates legacy infrastructure compromise creates immediate brand damage and operational disruption. FortiSIEM compromise affects security posture across enterprise, creating disclosure considerations. Audit committee oversight of legacy infrastructure security program required.
    
    disclosure_requirements: |
      SEC materiality assessment required for security operations platform compromises given impact on organization's ability to detect and respond to threats. FortiSIEM breach affects security posture across enterprise; legal counsel must evaluate whether this represents material change in risk profile requiring disclosure under cyber disclosure rules.
      
      Broadcast infrastructure hijacks affecting investor communications, public statements, or market-moving announcements trigger immediate disclosure obligations. Unauthorized content on corporate channels could constitute material misstatement requiring correction and investigation disclosure.
      
      Zero-day exploitation discoveries require evaluation of whether breach occurred during exploitation window. Cisco AsyncOS attacks running November 2025-January 2026 mean organizations must determine if their systems were compromised during this period and whether data accessed meets materiality thresholds. Coordinated vulnerability disclosure with vendor while conducting internal investigation creates disclosure timing complications requiring legal guidance.

analysis_and_insights:
  uncomfortable_truths: |
    Your legacy infrastructure is undefended and you don't even know it exists. Iran's satellite hijack succeeded because broadcast uplinks aren't in IT asset inventory, don't have security monitoring, and run with credentials nobody has rotated in years. Every organization has equivalent blind spots: building management systems controlling HVAC and fire suppression, emergency notification systems reaching entire facilities, public address platforms broadcasting to customers, and satellite communications supporting remote operations. These systems were installed by facilities teams or contractors, operate outside IT purview, and have never been security tested. When attackers discover them, exploitation is trivial but impact is catastrophic.
    
    Security operations platforms are single points of failure that make your entire security investment worthless when compromised. CVE-2025-64155 in FortiSIEM demonstrates attackers understand this asymmetry. Why waste time evading detection when you can compromise the detection platform itself? Once SIEM is controlled, attackers see everything defenders see, know what triggers alerts, and can modify logs hiding their activities. Every dollar spent on EDR, firewalls, and security tools generates zero value when underlying monitoring platform is compromised. Organizations that invested $20M in security stack discover it was theater once FortiSIEM falls.
    
    Password-based authentication is security theater that persists only through organizational inertia. 679,910 IPs are brute-forcing SSH credentials right now. This has been true for twenty years. We know passwords are vulnerable. We know certificate-based authentication eliminates the attack. Yet organizations continue accepting credential-based attacks because "migration is hard" or "users prefer passwords." The discomfort: every breach from brute-forced SSH credentials is self-inflicted wound where organization chose convenience over security and pretended vulnerability didn't exist until exploit occurred.
  
  strategic_lessons:
    - "Legacy infrastructure outside IT inventory represents highest-impact, lowest-defense attack surface; satellite hijacks, building controls, and communication systems exist as security blind spots"
    - "Security operations platforms are single points of failure; their compromise blinds defenders while providing attackers roadmap of all security controls to evade"
    - "Zero-day exploitation windows (2+ months for Cisco AsyncOS) exceed organizational detection capabilities; assume breach architecture required rather than perimeter defense"
    - "Password-based authentication remains dominant attack vector despite decades of awareness; 680K IPs conducting SSH brute-force demonstrates persistent credential-based risk"
    - "Public PoC code for critical vulnerabilities (FortiSIEM CVE-2025-64155) compresses exploitation timeline from months to days; patching becomes emergency response rather than routine maintenance"
    - "AI service expansion (OpenAI Sonata) requires continuous security evaluation; new capabilities introduce attack surface and data handling risks requiring governance frameworks"
    - "State-controlled broadcast infrastructure compromise (Iran) demonstrates political/activist targeting of media and communication systems will increase; critical infrastructure extends beyond traditional definitions"

forward_outlook:
  predictions: |
    Legacy infrastructure attacks will accelerate as adversaries catalog organizational blind spots. Iran satellite hijack provides blueprint for targeting broadcast systems, emergency alerts, public address platforms, and communication infrastructure. Activists, criminals, and nation-states will systematically probe building controls, HVAC systems, fire suppression, and facility management platforms discovering most run with default credentials and zero monitoring. By Q3 2026, expect headline incidents where attackers manipulate emergency notification systems, broadcast fake alerts through public address infrastructure, or control building environmental systems for extortion. Organizations treating facilities management and operational technology as "not IT's problem" will face catastrophic consequences.
    
    Security operations platforms will face sustained targeting as attackers recognize their strategic value. FortiSIEM's CVE-2025-64155 with public PoC will drive exploitation wave through Q1-Q2 2026. Splunk, Elastic, and other SIEM vendors will disclose similar vulnerabilities as security researchers and attackers focus on this high-value target class. By year-end 2026, expect multiple incidents where security tool compromise enabled multi-year undetected breaches only discovered through external notification or complete infrastructure rebuild. Organizations without independent monitoring of security platforms will discover compromises too late for effective response. Insurance market will begin excluding coverage for breaches enabled by compromised security operations platforms, viewing them as negligent infrastructure management rather than unforeseeable attacks.

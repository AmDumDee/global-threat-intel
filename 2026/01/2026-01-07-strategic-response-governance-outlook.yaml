  executive_decisions:
    - priority: "Critical"
      decision: "Mandate 'Enterprise-Only' AI Access Gateways"
      business_justification: "Bypasses browser-level 'Prompt Poaching' by disabling public web-interface access in favor of managed API endpoints or secure enterprise portals."
      cost_estimate: "$50k - $200k (Licensing + Gateway implementation)"
    
    - priority: "Critical"
      decision: "Establish a 'Hardened' Browser Baseline"
      business_justification: "Over 900,000 users were compromised by 'Featured' extensions. Centralized extension management (Allow-listing only) is now a survival requirement, not a convenience."
      cost_estimate: "Included in existing EDR/MDM spend; requires 40-80 man-hours for audit."

    - priority: "High"
      decision: "Formalize Ransomware 'Deletion' Policy"
      business_justification: "Avoids the $370k 'AT&T Trap.' Prevents chaotic decision-making during active extortion by pre-defining if/when the firm pays for non-leakage promises."
      cost_estimate: "Legal/Consulting fees: $25k - $50k"

  governance_implications:
    board_reporting: |
      Track 'Shadow AI' usage metrics and browser extension risk scores. Shift reporting from 'Number of attacks blocked' to 'Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) legitimate tool abuse.' Report on the integrity of 'Crown Jewel' data within Snowflake and other cloud-scale repositories.
    
    disclosure_requirements: |
      Under 2026 SEC/Global mandates, paying a ransom for 'deletion' must likely be disclosed as a material event. AI-driven data leaks via browser extensions may trigger 'Mass Notification' requirements if PII was involved in prompts.

analysis_and_insights:
  uncomfortable_truths: |
    We have entered the 'Post-Malware' era. Attackers like those in 'The Com' no longer need to write viruses; they simply need to be better at using your tools than your employees are. The fact that a 20-year-old soldier could compromise 15 telcos from a barracks proves that our 'Identity' layer is fundamentally broken. 
    
    Furthermore, the cybersecurity industry is complicit in 'Security Theater.' By allowing 'Featured' badges on extensions that scrape DOM data, platform providers have shifted the burden of safety entirely onto the end-user, who is systematically unqualified to bear it.

  strategic_lessons:
    - "Intent is the new IOC: We must monitor how tools are used, not just if they are present."
    - "Pay for recovery, never for silence: Paying for data deletion is a sub-prime investment with zero ROI."
    - "Governance is the product: In 2026, the company with the best AI governance wins the talent and trust race."

forward_outlook:
  predictions: |
    Within 12 months, we expect the rise of 'OAuth Worms'—malicious AI agents that move laterally between SaaS apps (Slack to Salesforce to M365) by hijacking 'Trusted' authorizations. This will render traditional endpoint security obsolete.
    
    The 'Talent Arms Race' will shift. By EOY 2026, the most valuable security hires won't be coders, but 'AI Orchestrators' capable of auditing autonomous agent behavior and managing the 'Truth Layer' of corporate metadata.
